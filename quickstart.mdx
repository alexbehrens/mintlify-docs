## Getting started with Forta

In this article you will gain a high-level understanding of Forta detection bot development including myths, development workflows, dApps and SDKs that will lay out a clear path to develop on Forta. This article is intended for developers who are new to Forta and assumes you already have some general knowledge about blockchains such as smart contracts and tokens. Letâ€™s jump right in!

The most important thing for new Forta developers to understand is that it is not a requirement to have experience with blockchain development to get started building on Forta. In fact, your web2 development experience transfers directly to detection bot development. In Forta, detection bots are programs running on the Forta Network that scan the blockchain for events of interest and alerts users about them e.g. large token transfers or declining account balances. While detection bots can be written in any language, Forta provides convenient SDKs in Javascript, Typescript and Python for you to get started easily. Detection bots are the heart of the Forta Network as they alert users of any suspicious or anomalous activity. There are currently many bots deployed for users to interact and integrate with.

### The Basics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Understanding the big picture">
    Let"s start by understanding the big picture of the Forta Network and the different components involved. Keep in mind that this diagram is an oversimplification to allow for easy understanding.

    ![30,000 foot view](fortahighlevel.png)

    On the far left there are the Forta developer tools that are used by detection bot developers to build and deploy bots to the Forta Network. These developer tools are described in more detail later on. Once deployed, the detection bots are run by Forta scan nodes. You can think of scan nodes as servers that provide capacity to the Forta Network. Scan nodes are responsible for running detection bots, providing them blockchain data and publishing any alerts. Detection bots use the blockchain data to detect some condition they are interested in, and can also make network calls to other APIs to combine richer data sources.

    In the middle of the diagram are the scan nodes that comprise the Forta Network. Anyone can run a scan node as long as they stake the required amount of FORT tokens. Each scan node listens for blocks and transactions from a blockchain. Currently the Forta Network runs scan nodes for EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchains such as Ethereum, Polygon, BNB, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism and Fantom. Each scan node is assigned a set of detection bots to run by the Forta Network. The scan node collects any alerts reported by the detection bots and publishes them. You can view the complete list of scan nodes on the [Forta App Network](https://app.forta.network/network) page.

    On the far right of the diagram are the users of the Forta Network who are interested in receiving alerts. Users can subscribe to alerts from a specific detection bot, or alerts about a specific blockchain address using the [Forta App](https://app.forta.network/). They can also browse and search the latest alerts using the [Forta App](https://app.forta.network/alerts). Also, more technical users can query for alerts using the [Forta API](api.md) to integrate alert feeds right into their own applications.

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
